# MS-Teams-Bot
Developing a MS-Teams Bot to attend your online class on time without you even opening your laptop (though I don't encourage it).

## Develpments
- Bot can take your commands, your class information through discord and alert you when it enters or leaves the class
- Automaatically logins through your MS-Teams account according to your time table turns off your camera and mic (for anonymity :P ) joins the class and leaves as soon as the assigned time reached.

## Working On
- Improvement of discord bot.
- Integration of discord bot with MS-Teams Bot
- Making things automatically run on cloud with least intervention from the user.
